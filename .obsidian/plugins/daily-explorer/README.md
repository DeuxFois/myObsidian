Daily Notes Explorer

This Obsidian plugin adds a left sidebar explorer that lists files whose basename matches YYYY-MM-DD (daily notes). Each item has a Delete button with confirmation.

Installation:
1. Copy the `daily-explorer` folder into your vault's `.obsidian/plugins` folder.
2. Reload Obsidian and enable "Daily Notes Explorer" in Settings -> Community plugins.

Notes:
- This is a minimal prototype. It assumes daily notes are named with `YYYY-MM-DD` in the filename.
- Deletion is irreversible; use with care.
